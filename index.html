      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        First off, welcome! I'm excited to begin the process of transforming your landscape into something beautiful. I have been in this industry for over 20 years and am still excited every spring to begin helping my clients realize their dreams. I have extensive experience in my own garden and am always in search of new and interesting plants to incorporate. I'm a believer in right plant-right place.  This philosophy helps with plant health, successful landscapes and keeps maintenance to a minimum.  I am always cognizant of multi-seasonal interest and the balance between evergreen and deciduous plants.  My goal is to create an environment that birds and butterflies love as much as you do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a native Oregonian and have owned 3 homes in the Portland area.  Gardening became an obsession shortly after buying our first place.   I've always had an eye for color and space, and also enjoy decorating, photography and refinishing furniture.  If it's crafty, I probably love it!
      </p>

    <section id="process" class="process info">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Enough about me, let me explain the design process.   We'll get acquainted at our first meeting and discuss your goals.  I'd like to walk around the property and discuss what you'd like to keep, and what you want to change.  I'd like a list of any important elements that need to be in the final design.   Feel free to give me your must-haves as well as a list of optional elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will measure and photograph the property and then lay out the site in a computer program.  This step is likely similar to something have seen on TV. My program will create 2D and 3D views for you, rarely black and white CAD style unless you request that.  Generally,  my clients much prefer color renderings.   We will "meet" again via Zoom in a few weeks with a rough draft,  COVID has changed how we meet but I am finding that the process is being streamlined and the result is just as good, if not better.  This process is collaborative, so you may have as much input as you'd like.  Since I charge by the hour, please be mindful of how much time you want to spend making changes and iterations.      </p>
      <p>
        (I will follow your lead on that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Once complete, the design will be delivered as a PDF document.  I will include a plant list and supporting images.  The final product can be sent to your contractor for a bid, or you can install it yourself.  You have the flexibility to make all of those decisions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You</em> will own the design.
